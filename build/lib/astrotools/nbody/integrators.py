"""
Integration schemes.  ASTR 5820, Problem Set 1, stage B (and Set 4).

You implement one function: rk4_step. Euler ships complete as the comparator, and
the driver that loops over steps is provided, so the only thing you write is the
scheme itself.

    pytest tests/test_ps1b_integrators.py -v

STEPPER CONVENTION
------------------
Every stepper has the signature

    stepper(func, t, y, dt) -> y_new

where ``func(t, y)`` returns dy/dt. Week 9's leapfrog uses the same signature but
takes an ACCELERATION function instead, since a symplectic scheme has to see
positions and velocities separately. The driver below does not care which.

WHAT THE TEST IS CHECKING
-------------------------
Integrate exactly one orbital period and the exact answer is the initial
condition -- so the distance between the final and initial states IS the global
error, with no reference solution needed. Euler's global error should fall by 2
when dt is halved; a fourth-order scheme's should fall by 16. That factor of 16
is the inference you made in Lecture 7 from the Euler and midpoint amplification
factors, and this test is where it is checked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        func(t, y) -> dy/dt, returning an array the same shape as y.
    t : float
        Current time [s].
    y : ndarray

        Step size [s].

    Returns

    Notes
    -----

    The number of steps is chosen so the integration lands exactly on t_end, and
    dt is adjusted by less than one part in n_steps to make it do so. Exact
    landing matters for the convergence test, which compares the state after a
    whole number of orbits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stepper : callable
        One of euler_step, rk4_step, (later) leapfrog_step.
    func : callable
        Passed straight through to the stepper.
    y0 : array_like
        Initial state vector.
    t_span : tuple of float
        (t_start, t_end) [s].
    dt : float
        Requested step size [s]; rounded to divide the interval evenly.
    store_every : int, optional
        Store every Nth state. Use a large value for long integrations -- Week 9
        runs 1e5 orbits and you do not want all of it in memory.

    Returns
    -------
    t : ndarray, shape (M,)
        Times of the stored states [s].
    y : ndarray, shape (M, len(y0))
        Stored states.
